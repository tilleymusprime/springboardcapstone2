# springboardcapstone2
Thank you for looking at my project!
The goal of this project is to predict if a customer will have payment problems based on their past financial history


Project Layout:
The final report word document is the written out paper.  It is a summary of the code
The first sheet of code to read is the Capstone2Cleaning sheet. This sheet has all of the initial exploratory data as well as missing values.  

The next sheet to look at is c2VIF.  This shows the process of how we remove any multicollinearity from the model

Finally, the last sheet to look at is random forest.  This sheet contains the sampling issues faced as well as the modeling process and validation.

There is also a powerpoint presentation.

Enjoy!
